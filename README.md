## ISSUES

These errors in development will need to be addressed, it's mostly related to server side HTML rendering in NextJS, for more: https://nextjs.org/docs/messages/react-hydration-error

-   [] Error: Hydration failed because the initial UI does not match what was rendered on the server.
-   [] Error: There was an error while hydrating. Because the error happened outside of a Suspense boundary, the entire root will switch to client rendering.

## TODOs

-[] Improve types
